			<p>I have been playing football for roughly eightteen years. I started when I was six and have played ever since. It has become something that is ingrained in me and I can no longer live without some form of a connection to the game. Watching, Playing, Coaching, etc. Even the weightlifting aspect of the sport has become something that over the years, through continued improvement I have grown to love and partake in everyday.</p>

		<article class="about-art-two"> With football being such a large part of my life it has taught me so many things about myself over the years. Discipline to the game and other parts of my life; the meaning and value of hardwork and what it takes to achieve the goals you set;and what true love is... Though it is never easy, and things get hard, but when everything lines up there is no better feeling in the world for me.</article>

I am a winner of the Hartford Healthcare Courage Award, and am extremely grateful for the opportunity to accept the award.</p>
